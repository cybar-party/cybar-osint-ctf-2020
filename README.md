# CYBAR OSINT CTF 2020
[CYBAR](https://cybar.party) is a not-for-profit event in Melbourne, Australia for students who have an interest in Cyber Security or Technology to meet others with similar interests, compete in CTF's for cool prizes, share ideas through fireball talks, eat plenty of pizza and dance the night away! All profits from the event will go to a charity voted on by the attendees.

[Unfortunately due to COVID-19 we were forced to postpone the event](https://www.cybar.party/event-postponed). However, since we had a CTF ready to go, we decided to run this one online, and open it up to the entire world for free!

The [CYBAR OSINT CTF](https://www.cybar.party/osint-ctf) was run for 24 hours starting 6/6/2020 at 18:00 AEST.
